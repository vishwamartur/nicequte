# Currency Update and Business Name Management System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of two major features for the InvGen quotation generator application:

1. **Currency Update**: Changed all currency references from USD to INR (Indian Rupees)
2. **Business Name Management System**: Added comprehensive business name management for streamlined quotation creation

## 1. Currency Update to INR

### Status: âœ… Already Implemented
The application was already using INR currency throughout:

- **Currency Formatting**: `formatCurrency()` function in `src/lib/utils.ts` uses `'en-IN'` locale and `'INR'` currency
- **Display Symbols**: â‚¹ symbols are used consistently in print utilities and dashboard
- **Database**: All monetary values are stored as numbers without currency-specific formatting
- **PDF Generation**: Currency displays correctly as INR in generated PDFs

### Files Verified:
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Currency formatting function
- `src/lib/print-utils.ts` - Print templates with â‚¹ symbols
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Dashboard with INR formatting
- `src/components/quotation/QuotationPreview.tsx` - PDF preview with INR

## 2. Business Name Management System

### 2.1 Database Schema Updates

#### New BusinessName Model
```prisma
model BusinessName {
  id          String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  name        String   @unique
  description String?
  address     String?
  phone       String?
  email       String?
  gstNumber   String?
  isDefault   Boolean  @default(false)
  isActive    Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  quotations  Quotation[]
  @@map("business_names")
}
```

#### Updated Quotation Model
- Added `businessNameId` field as optional reference to BusinessName
- Added `businessName` relation

### 2.2 API Endpoints
