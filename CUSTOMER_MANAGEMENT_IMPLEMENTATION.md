# Customer Management Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of customer management functionality in the InvGen quotation generator application, including customer database management and text visibility fixes.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Customer Database Management

#### **Database Schema**
- Customer model already exists in Prisma schema with all required fields
- Includes name, email, phone, address, GST number, and timestamps
- Relationships with quotations for tracking customer history

#### **API Endpoints**
- `GET /api/customers` - List customers with search and pagination
- `POST /api/customers` - Create new customer
- `GET /api/customers/[id]` - Get specific customer with quotation history
- `PUT /api/customers/[id]` - Update customer information
- `DELETE /api/customers/[id]` - Delete customer (with quotation validation)

#### **Customer Management Page**
- Full CRUD interface at `/customers`
- Search functionality by name, email, or phone
- Customer cards showing contact information and quotation count
- Edit and delete actions with proper validation
- Empty state with call-to-action for first customer

### 2. Enhanced Quotation Creation

#### **Customer Selection Options**
- **Select Existing Customer**: Dropdown with all saved customers
- **Manual Entry**: Traditional form input for one-time customers
- Radio button toggle between selection modes

#### **Smart Customer Handling**
- Auto-fill customer information when selecting existing customer
- Option to save manually entered customers for future use
- Clear selection button to switch from selected to manual mode
- Disabled fields when customer is selected (prevents accidental changes)

#### **Form Validation**
- Required customer selection when in "select" mode
- Proper validation for email format and phone numbers
- Customer existence checking to prevent duplicates

### 3. Text Visibility Fixes

#### **CSS Improvements**
- Added explicit text color declarations for all input elements
- Fixed placeholder text visibility with proper contrast
- Ensured disabled input fields have readable text
- Applied consistent color scheme across all form elements

#### **Specific Fixes**
- Input fields: `color: #1f2937 !important` (dark gray)
- Placeholders: `color: #6b7280 !important` (medium gray)
- Disabled fields: `color: #6b7280 !important` with light background
- Text classes: Explicit color values for gray-900, gray-700, gray-600

## Technical Implementation
